# Multivariable Linear Regression in Python

Multivariable linear regression is all about taking in a set of data points (x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, &#x2026;,x<sub>n</sub>, y) and to be able to predict y values for some other data points (x<sub>0</sub>',x<sub>1</sub>',&#x2026;,x<sub>n</sub>'). I'm giving an example here on how to do so in Python as well as computing the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) to see how well the predictor variables model y.
